        <p>When did you start shooting film and what drives you to keep shooting today?
          
          <br>
            <br>
          
         NM: I picked up my first camera a little over a year ago after being an observer and admirer of film photography for a long time. It started when Tumblr was a thing; I would reblog a lot of photos similar to what I shoot now — bright colors, summery tones, buildings and places I loved seeing over and over.

After a little internet sleuthing, I found that most of the photos were shot on film cameras, which gave them that dreamy lo-fi quality that makes me choose film over digital every time. I finally decided to give it a try and ordered a film camera from Etsy. Nothing special, just something that would help me get familiar with focus, light, and pulling the advance lever.
            <br>
            <br>
            I keep shooting because I love it. I really can’t stress enough how much I love it. I never in a zillion years thought of myself as a photographer or an artist. I’ve always felt very intimidated by photographers carrying big DSLR cameras with tons of buttons and lenses. That doesn’t feel like me, but this does. Film, and the way I shoot it, feels like me.

        <p>Who or what influenced your photography when you first started out and who continues to influence you today?
          
          <br>
            <br>
          
          NM: When I first got into film, I was pretty fanatical about Pia Riverola’s work. Her photos give me the same feeling I want to inspire in other people — warm nostalgia. Every time I look at one of her photos, I feel like I’m actually there, smelling the cherry blossoms in Japan or feeling the warm wind of the California desert. She’s so talented, and has such a knack for capturing the same kind of light I chase in my photography.

        <p>What’s your next challenge…your next step? How do you see yourself improving your technique? What aspect of your photography would you like to try and master in the next 12 months?
<br>
          <br>
          
          NM: I love to shoot street photography and architecture, but I get pretty shy about portraits. I’d like to get more comfortable in that arena. Not “good,” per se…just more confident in taking them. Hopefully that comes with practice.

I’ve played a little with 120 film over the past three months and would really like to get a medium format camera to experiment with. My heart still belongs to 35mm, but I think some projects are far more suited to medium format.

Finally, I feel like it’s probably time for me to try black and white film. I’ve never tried!</p>

        <p>Do you have a subject matter or style you always find yourself being drawn to? Why?
<br>
          <br>
          
          NM: I live in San Francisco, so definitely the architecture. The bright, colorful victorians and some of the smaller walk up apartments feature pretty heavily in a lot of my photos. I’ve sometimes photographed the same house on different times, on different days, with different lights just because of the way it looks. I’m really inspired by different perspectives and ways of looking at the same subject.
          <br>
            <br>
            When I travel, I capture whatever catches my eye. Most of the time, that also seems to lean towards architecture, but I always just try to capture the sense of place… or how I’m feeling while I’m there.</p>

        <p>You have 2 minutes to prepare for an unknown assignment. You can take one camera, one lens, two films and you have no idea what you’ll be shooting. What do you take with you and why?
<br>
          <br>
          
          NM: If I’m picking from the cameras I own, I’d probably take my Canon AE-1, believe it or not. It’s such a sturdy little camera, and I’m so familiar with its focus that I know I can create the up close and personal or far away shots that I’d want. Since I’m not sure what I’m shooting, that would probably be the most versatile choice.


          <br>
            <br>
           The two rolls I would bring would probably be Kodak Ultramax 400 for day time (my go-to!) and Cinestill 800T for night time.

        <p>You have an unlimited supply of film to shoot in one location for the rest of your life. What do you take, where do you go and why?
<br>
          <br>
          
          NM: Since this doesn’t say I’d have to pick a particular stock — Kodak, that way I can shoot Portra, Ultramax, and Colorplus on rotation!
<br><br>
            
Where I’d go: Europe. I’d go backpacking with my favorite point and shoot and visit Spain, Greece, Scotland — the list goes on. Places I’ve been to but didn’t have a film camera with me, and places I’ve only seen in magazines. I’d love to spend and document a significant amount of time all over the continent. I also went to Israel recently and would love to go back there with more film and more time — an incredibly beautiful country.

        <p>You can never use film again. What’s your last roll of film, where and how will you expose it and why? 
            <br>
            <br>
            NM: I’d want to shoot Fujicolor Industrial 100 in Japan, where it’s made. I’ve shot one roll of this stock before and was blown away by how beautiful and bright the color pops are. It made the sky look beautiful, almost violet. I’ve always wanted to visit Japan and shoot film there, so for my very last film project, that’s a no brainer.

        <p>What do you think is the biggest misconception about film photography today and how would you set it straight?
            <br>
            <br>
           NM: Probably that it’s not something you should try unless you’re good at digital photography. I think I’m a very so-so digital photographer, but film is a completely different medium! I’ve had some people ask me what digital camera I started with and…I didn’t. I never thought of myself as a photographer or played with framing and light on digital the way I do with film. I do think film has made me a better digital photographer though.

        <p>In your opinion, what’s the future of film photography?
            <br>
            <br>
         NM: Unsure. That’s not a bad thing though. I don’t know what the future of it looks like, but in an increasingly digital world, I hope it retains its analog soul, even just beyond the literally analog process. I hope the developing process, with chemicals and darkrooms and negatives, stays too. Innovation is cool, but some things should be kept sacred. I like to think film is one of those things.

        <p>NM: Shoot what makes you happy. Not what you think is popular, what will get you Instagram likes, or what everyone else is looking at. What do you look at when you don’t have your camera on you? What catches your eye? How does the light hit it? What do you like about it? Those are the things that I think about before making a photo. A shadow can be beautiful if captured in just the right way.
